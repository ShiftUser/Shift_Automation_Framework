# Shift Test Automation Framework

### Introduction
Hi My name is Supattra Boonchaleeüñê , I have created an Automation Framework for Shift. This project utilizes a powerful stack of technologies, including Java for robustness, Selenium and WebDriver for web automation, WinAppDriver for Windows application automation, TestNG for test management, and AWT Robot for simulating user interactions. The project also contains automated tests for Shift, a web browser, focusing on installation and verification processes.

### Test Cases Performed
- Verify Shift Browser Download
- Verify Shift Browser Installation
- Verify Login and Unread Emails Count
- Verify Adding Workspace and Unread Emails Status
- Verify Login to Messenger Application

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK installed
- IntelliJ IDEA or any preferred Java IDE
- ChromeDriver ‚Äì [Download here](https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-for-testing-public/122.0.6261.128/win64/chromedriver-win64.zip)
- WinAppDriver - [Download here](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppDriver/releases/download/v1.2.99/WindowsApplicationDriver-1.2.99-win-x64.exe)
- Maven

### Project Setup
1. Download and Install WinappDriver from the location in the prerequisite. Once installed Note the location/path where it is installed. **‚Äì- Note 1**
2. After WinappDriver is installed turn on developer mode settings in your local system Settings.
3. Install Maven . Set Maven path in Environment Variables after installation
4. Install Java JDK . Set Java path in Environment Variables after installation
5. Download ChromeDriver and unzip it. Note the path where it is installed **‚Äì Note 2**
6. Install Shift Windows application manually and keep a note of the default path/location where it is getting installed. **‚Äì Note 3**
7. Once you have the location of the Shift exe then uninstall Shift . You can follow the link [How to uninstall Shift](https://support.tryshift.com/kb/article/679-how-to-uninstall-shift-from-your-computer-windows/)
8. Make sure you also delete temp files after installation ‚Äì ‚Äú%temp%‚Äù .
9. Clone the repository to your local machine.
10. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE 

11. Ensure all dependencies are installed and configured correctly.
12. Navigate to the folder--Shift_automation/src/test/java/Utilities/Constants.java And change the path for line 5, 6, 7, 9 respectively. I wish you have noted the location above properly and had not lost it üòä

14. Once you change the path try to reload maven 
15. Check for build success.

### Running the Tests
1.	There are two options for running this project
   
**First Case :-** Run the Class one by one.

**Second Case:-** Entirely run the project 

2.	**First Case(Run the Class one by one):-** 
- If you want to run one by one. Make sure Shift is not installed in your system and have no folders related to it also clear your temp files from your local system. Now once your are done with clearing all your Shift related files and Temp.
  
- Navigate to ‚ÄúShift_Browser_TestCase.java‚Äù and then right click on the class Shift_Browser_TestCase.java. You will get an option to Run. Click on Run and Do the same for different class i.e Shift_WinAppdriverTestCase.
Hola, you have successfully run the project. You can check the reports in Shift reports folder which is generated in the project location with the date and time stamp.

3.	**Second Case (Entirely run the project):-**
-  Now the second case, If you want to run the entire project at once. Make sure Shift is not installed in your system and have no folders related to it also clear your temp files from your local system. If you have followed the first case of running the project i.e. Run the class one by one then you have to also make sure that before uninstalling Shift application , you logout from everywhere in shift, delete all the workspaces, delete the messenger application  created by test automation. If you don‚Äôt delete test case will not execute as expected and may fail. All fault to you üòä
- then Navigate to smokeRunner.xml. Right click on smokeRunner.xml and Run it. and wait the execution to get started.
  
Hola your test execution is successful, You can again check the reports in Shift reports folder which is generated in the project location with the date and time stamp.

**Also, I am keeping an extra class for my Interview Demo Purpose i.e. ‚ÄúShift_WinAppdriverTestCase_One_By_One.java‚Äù. Please do not touch üòä -**


### Reports
Please note once the execution is successful the report will be generated along with a date and time stamp in the project directory This is how the report will look like:

### Future Steps
- Attaching Screenshot for failure and pass in the report.
- Adding Wait Statement 
- Making the framework more reliable
